## Jena Redux

This is a fork of [Apache Jena](https://github.com/apache/jena).

The intention here is to explore a code structure that supports modular `JMOD` builds and is
compliant with the JSR 376 *Jigsaw" specification.

To build modules, checkout the jpms branch and run the `buildtools/src/install/install-jpms.sh` script

## Requirements
